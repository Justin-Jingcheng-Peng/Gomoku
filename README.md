# Gomoku
Easy Gomoku

Background Information about Gomoku: Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty spots. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Inspiration: This project idea came from my high school where I always used a pen to draw grids on the paper to play this game. At that time, I wanted to develop an online board that can help me playing this game with my friend.

Technology I used: HTML/CSS/Javascript
